# Highlands Interview Test Application

The backend is a full CRUD interface for products. Since this was my first project learning Rails, I decided to go slightly beyond the scope in order to get to know Rails. Pages are styled with Bootstrap 4.

## Software
**Rails version:** 5.1.6.1

**Database:** sqlite3

## Instructions
To run the application:
1. Download it to your computer and `cd path\to\highlands_interview_test`.
1. Launch the rails server `rails s`
1. Open a web browser and go to `localhost:3000`

Since it uses the default sqlite3 database, there is no need to configure an external database.

## Pages
**Create a Product** &ndash; `localhost:3000/products/new`
**React-powered product list with search** &ndash; `localhost:3000`
